abstract = {An Automated Mobile Robot can navigate on a floor freely by avoiding obstacles and walking on the shortest path between two points. It uses a vector map of the floor and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for calculating shortest path. For obstacle avoidance, it uses ultrasonic sensor modules and pre-loaded intelligence. The RFID scanner is used for identification and verification of destination and re-calibrating position of the robot on a path by detecting other locations on the path. This system requires 195 RPM and 1.75 seconds duration for the robot to successfully read the RFID tag.},
