Adaptable Critical Patient Caring system is a key concern for hospitals in developing countries like Bangladesh. Most of the hospital in Bangladesh lack serving proper health service due to unavailability of appropriate, easy and scalable smart systems. The aim of this project is to build an adequate system for hospitals to serve critical patients with a real-time feedback method. In this paper, we propose a generic architecture, associated terminology and a classificatory model for observing critical patient‚Äôs health condition with machine learning and IBM cloud computing as Platform as a service (PaaS). Machine Learning (ML) based health prediction of the patients is the key concept of this research. IBM Cloud, IBM Watson studio is the platform for this research to store and maintain our data and ml models. For our ml models, we have chosen the following Base Predictors: Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and MLP Classifier. For improving the accuracy of the model, the bagging method of ensemble learning has been used. The following algorithms are used for ensemble learning: Bagging Random Forest, Bagging Extra Trees, Bagging KNeighbors, Bagging SVC, and Bagging Ridge. We have developed a mobile application named ‚ÄúCritical Patient Management System - CPMS‚Äù for real-time data and information view. The system architecture is designed in such a way that the ml models can train and deploy in a real-time interval by retrieving the data from IBM Cloud and the cloud information can also be accessed through CPMS in a requested time interval. To help the doctors, the ml models will predict the condition of a patient. If the prediction based on the condition gets worse, the CPMS will send an SMS to the duty doctor and nurse for getting immediate attention to the patient. Combining with the ml models and mobile application, the project may serve as a smart healthcare solution for the hospitals.</div>
