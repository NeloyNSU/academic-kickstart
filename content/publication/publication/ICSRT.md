For different purposes, a service robot that can be controlled remotely will play a significant role in the expansion of robotics automation systems. In the developing countries like Bangladesh, everyone is concerned about safety from both natural and human-made situations like Disposal of Bombs, rescuing objects from dangerous places, a useful assistant for handicapped people. In this paper, we propose to make a Robotic Car (RC) which helps to enter an environment of higher risks, grab and move to an appropriate place. For developing this generic model, Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ is used as the central control unit for the robot. Six Degree of Freedom (DOF) Arm is used to compute as the main factor for grabbing the objects. Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter is the remote handheld controller for the RC. Also, a raspberry pi 0.6MP camera is integrated for live video streaming. The live streaming will provide the actual scenario of the environment to operate, control and navigate the RC. This robot also carries some important sensors like a Gas sensor, Ultrasonic Sonar Sensor and 3-Axis Digital Compass to bring out the scientific task of the robot. This prototype can be both used for educational and research purpose. The performance of the robot can be measured by the transmission of the video streaming, control system success rate for RF controller, outcomes of the sensors and the accuracy of the 6 DOF Arm.</div>
