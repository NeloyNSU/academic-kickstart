This paper introduces a rescue robot named Sigma-3 which is developed for potential applications such as helping hands for humans where a human canâ€™t reach to have an assessment of the hazardous environment. Also, these kinds of robot can be controlled remotely with an adequate control system. The proposed methodology forces on two issues â€“ 1. Novel mechanism design for measuring rotation, joints, links of Degree of Freedom (DOF) for an arm which is integrated with Sigma-3 2. Precise measuring of end-effector motion control over three dimensions. In the proposed mechanism design, the DOF measurement is presented by a planar and spatial mechanism where 4 types of rigid joints build up each DOF with controlling by six High Torque MG996R servo motors. Rotation and DOF measurement are consisting of different theoretical references of Rotation Matrix, Inverse Kinematics with experimental results. Presented methodology over Oscillation Damping performance exhibits less than 3% error while configuring for on hands testing. Another evaluation of operating time state strongly.</div>
